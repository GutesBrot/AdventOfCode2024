## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event that provides 25 days of programming challenges. Each day features a new puzzle, with increasing difficulty as the month progresses.

It's a great way to:
- Improve your programming skills 🧑‍💻
- Learn new algorithms and problem-solving techniques 📚
- Get into the holiday spirit 🎅🎄

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized by day, with each folder containing:
- The puzzle description (`README.md` or a link to the website).
- My solution in `your programming language of choice`.
- Any additional notes or test cases.
